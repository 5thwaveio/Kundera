Annotation based java library for NoSQL databases
=====================================================
The idea behind Kundera is to make working with NoSQL Databases drop-dead simple and fun. Kundera does not reinvent the wheel by making another client library; rather it leverages the existing libraries and builds - on top of them - a wrap-around API to help developers do away with unnecessary boiler plate codes, and program a neater-and-cleaner code that reduces code-complexity and improves quality. And above all, improves productivity.

Understanding Kundera only takes 5 minutes. Please read the following introductory article http://anismiles.wordpress.com/2010/06/30/kundera-knight-in-the-shining-armor/

Objectives
===========
To completely remove unnecessary details, such as Column lists, Super Column lists, byte arrays, Data encoding etc.
To be able to work directly with Domain models just with the help of annotations
To eliminate “code plumbing”, so as to keep the flow of data processing clear and obvious
To completely separate out NoSQL Databases and their concerns from application-level logic for robust application development
To include the latest NoSQL Databases without breaking anything
